 Admin Guide

## Security

### SSL Configuration
TLS certificates must be rotated every 90 days.
The configuration file is located at /etc/ssl/config.yaml.
Restart the gateway service after renewal.

### Authentication
TLS is also used during OAuth authentication.
OAuth tokens expire every 24 hours.
Token refresh does not require certificate rotation.

## Networking

### Gateway Configuration
The gateway handles TLS termination.
Improper TLS settings may cause downtime.
